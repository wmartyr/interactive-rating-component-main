## My process

I started coding the HTML then styled the rating card first. And then tested the basic Javascript to see if I can retrieve the rating value and pass it on to the thank you card. After making sure that cards transition, I did the CSS for the thank you card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JS DOM manipulations and events

### What I learned

I had a chance to practice more HTML and CSS. This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge with JS.

### Continued development

There might be some techniques that would reduce the number of classes that I use. It's something that I can keep my eye on as I continue my learning journey.

### Useful resources

As usual, it's google, stack overflow, and w3schools.
